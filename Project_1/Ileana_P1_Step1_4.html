    <p> There’s a story in the Quran <br>
      that I thought about a lot during my first<br>
      eight months in solitary confinement.<br>
      In it, a group of persecuted Christians<br>
      find refuge in a cave.<br>
      They, and a dog they have with them,<br>
      fall into a deep sleep.<br>
      They wake up under the impression<br>
       that they’ve taken a nap:<br>
        In fact, it’s 300 years later.<br>
         One version of the story tells <br>
         of how one of them goes out to buy food<br>
          — and I can only imagine how hungry<br>
          they must’ve been after 300 years<br>
          — and discovers that his money is obsolete now,<br>
          a museum item. <br>
          That’s when he realizes<br>
           how long they have actually been absent. </p>

    <p>The hyperlink <br>
      was my currency six years ago.<br>
       Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, <br>
       the hyperlink provided <br>
       a diversity and decentralisation <br>
       that the real world lacked.<br>
        The hyperlink represented<br>
         the open, interconnected <br>
         spirit of the world wide web<br>
          — a vision that started<br>
          with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. <br>
          The hyperlink was a way to abandon<br>
           centralization<br>
            — all the links, lines and hierarchies<br>
            — and replace them with<br>
            something more distributed, <br>
            a system of nodes and networks.</p>

    <p>Blogs gave form<br>
       to that spirit of decentralization: <br>
       They were windows into lives <br>
       you’d rarely know much about;<br>
        bridges that connected different<br>
         lives to each other and<br>
          thereby changed them.<br>
          Blogs were cafes where<br>
           people exchanged diverse <br>
           ideas on any and every topic<br>
            you could possibly be interested in. <br>
            They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.</p>

    <p>Since I got out of jail,<br>
       though, I’ve realized <br>
       how much the hyperlink <br>
       has been devalued, almost made obsolete.</p>

    <p>Nearly every social network<br>
       now treats a link as just the same <br>
       as it treats any other object<br>
        — the same as a photo, <br>
       or a piece of text<br>
        — instead of seeing it as a way<br>
        to make that text richer.<br>
        <br> You’re encouraged to post <br>
        one single hyperlink and expose <br>
        it to a quasi-democratic process <br>
        of liking and plussing and hearting:<br>
         Adding several links to a piece of text<br>
          is usually not allowed. <br>
          Hyperlinks are objectivized,<br>
           <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; isolated,<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stripped of their powers.</p>
