    <p> There’s a story in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. <br> In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. <br>They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. <br>They wake up under the impression that they’ve taken a nap: In fact, it’s 300 years later. <br>One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food — and I can only imagine how hungry they must’ve been after 300 years — and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item.<br> That’s when he realizes how long they have actually been absent. </p>

    <p>The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. <br>Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. <br>The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web — a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. <br>The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization — all the links, lines and hierarchies — and replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks.</p>

    <p>Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: <br>They were windows into lives you’d rarely know much about; <br>bridges that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. <br>Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. <br>They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.</p>

    <p>Since I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete.</p>

    <p>Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. <br>You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: <br>Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed.<br> Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.</p>
